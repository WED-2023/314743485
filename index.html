  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="about-text">
    Etti Gochberg was born on June 7, 1940, in Kishinev, the capital of Moldova. She was the only child of Mina and Boris. 
    When she was one year old, her father was sent to fight in World War II but never returned, and it was understood that he had been killed. 
    At home, they spoke Russian, Romanian, and Yiddish. As a child, Etti loved to sing, dance, and knit.
    Etti and her husband Zima (my grandfather) were classmates for seven years, and later they got married in the Soviet Union and had two children. 
    After immigrating to Israel in 1972, my grandmother worked at the Afula Municipality in engineering and urban planning. 
    She also volunteered at the National Insurance Institute, served as an advisor on matters of aging and disability, and managed a senior citizens‚Äô club in Afula.
    Etti loved singing very much and was active in the local choir.

  <h2>Q&A</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Role:</strong><br>
          <strong>Web1</strong> ‚Äì The user was passive. They only read and viewed information (like articles, static HTML pages). There was no way to interact with the site or upload content.<br>
          <strong>Web2</strong> ‚Äì The user became active. They also create content ‚Äì write posts, upload photos, comment and share (like on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.). But the control over the data remains with the platforms.<br>
          <strong>Web3</strong> ‚Äì The user is also the owner. They not only create content, but also control their data and the apps they use through decentralized technologies like blockchain. The user can also have ownership via tokens or NFTs.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Data Ownership:</strong><br>
          <strong>Web1</strong> ‚Äì Information was written and stored by website owners only. Users could only consume content.<br>
          <strong>Web2</strong> ‚Äì Users create most of the content, but the control and ownership of the data belongs to large companies (like Google, Facebook, etc.).<br>
          <strong>Web3</strong> ‚Äì The data belongs to the users themselves. They hold it in digital wallets, and the systems operate without a central authority ‚Äì using blockchain technology.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Monetization Model:</strong><br>
          <strong>Web1</strong> ‚Äì There was no clear business model. Very few ads, and most websites had no income source.<br>
          <strong>Web2</strong> ‚Äì The main model is based on advertising and selling user data. Platforms profit from user-generated content.<br>
          <strong>Web3</strong> ‚Äì Users can earn directly. They can sell content, participate in projects using tokens, use decentralized finance (DeFi), and trade NFTs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Example Use Case:</strong><br>
      <u>Searching for and buying a concert ticket:</u><br><br>

      <strong>Web1:</strong><br>
      The user enters the venue‚Äôs website. A simple text page is shown with date and time. There is no online purchase option ‚Äì only a phone number or physical address. The website is not updated in real time.<br>
      <em>The user is only a viewer ‚Äì no interaction.</em><br><br>

      <strong>Web2:</strong><br>
      The user visits a site like Eventim. They choose a seat, pay by credit card, and receive the ticket by email. They see ratings and reviews of past shows, but all the data passes through the platform, which holds ownership of it.<br>
      <em>The user is active ‚Äì but still depends on the platform.</em><br><br>

      <strong>Web3:</strong><br>
      The user purchases an NFT ticket through a decentralized app (DApp). The ticket is stored in their digital wallet and can be freely transferred or sold. The entire process is open, secure, and without middlemen.<br>
      <em>The user has full control over ownership and privacy.</em>
